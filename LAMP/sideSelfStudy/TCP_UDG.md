# Transport Layer Protocols: TCP and UDP

## INTRODUCTION

Communication between devices on a network depends heavily on protocols that govern how data is transmitted and received. At the Transport Layer of the OSI model, two major protocols are used: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP). Although both facilitate data transfer, they differ significantly in terms of reliability, speed, and communication methods. Understanding these differences helps in selecting the most appropriate protocol for different networking applications.

## Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

TCP is a transport-layer protocol designed to provide dependable communication between devices. Before any data exchange occurs, TCP establishes a connection between the communicating systems. This process ensures that information is delivered correctly and in the proper sequence.

One of TCP’s greatest strengths is its reliability. It verifies that packets reach their destination and automatically retransmits any missing or corrupted data. Additionally, TCP controls the rate of transmission to prevent network congestion and maintain efficient communication.

Because of these features, TCP is commonly used in applications where data accuracy is more important than speed. Examples include web browsing, email communication, file transfers, and secure remote connections.

### Key Features of TCP

* Requires a connection before transmitting data.
* Ensures accurate and complete delivery of information.
* Maintains the correct order of transmitted packets.
* Uses flow control and error-checking mechanisms.
* Introduces additional overhead due to its reliability features.

## User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

UDP takes a different approach to data transmission. Unlike TCP, it does not establish a dedicated connection before sending information. Instead, packets are transmitted directly to the destination without confirmation of receipt.

As a result, UDP offers faster communication and lower processing overhead. However, it does not provide guarantees regarding packet delivery, sequencing, or error recovery. If packets are lost during transmission, UDP does not attempt to resend them.

UDP is particularly useful in situations where speed is more critical than perfect accuracy. Applications such as online gaming, live video streaming, internet telephony, and DNS services often rely on UDP to minimize delays.

### Key Features of UDP

* Operates without establishing a connection.
* Offers faster data transmission.
* Uses minimal protocol overhead.
* Does not guarantee packet delivery or order.
* Lacks built-in congestion and flow control mechanisms.

## Comparing TCP and UDP

The primary distinction between TCP and UDP lies in their approach to communication. TCP focuses on reliability and accuracy, while UDP emphasizes speed and efficiency.

| Header Size          | Larger                              | Smaller                 |
| Typical Uses         | Email, web browsing, file transfers | Streaming, gaming, VoIP |

## Common Internet Protocols and Port Numbers

Several network services operate through specific port numbers that allow devices to identify and access particular applications.

### HTTP

HTTP, which facilitates communication between web browsers and web servers, traditionally uses Port 80. It transfers data without encryption and is commonly associated with standard web traffic.

### HTTPS

HTTPS enhances web security by encrypting transmitted data through SSL/TLS technologies. It operates on Port 443 and is the standard protocol for secure web communication.

### SSH

SSH provides a secure method for remotely accessing and managing computer systems. It uses Port 22 and protects transmitted data through encryption.

### FTP

FTP is used for transferring files between systems. Port 21 handles control operations, while separate dynamically assigned ports are used for actual data transfers.

### Telnet

Telnet enables remote access to devices through Port 23. However, because it lacks encryption, it has largely been replaced by more secure alternatives such as SSH.

### SFTP

SFTP combines file transfer functionality with the security features of SSH. It operates through Port 22 and is widely used for secure file sharing.

## Summary

TCP and UDP are both essential components of network communication. TCP provides dependable and structured data transmission, making it suitable for applications where accuracy is essential. UDP, on the other hand, offers a lightweight and high-speed communication method that supports real-time services where occasional data loss is acceptable. Choosing between these protocols depends on the specific needs of the application, balancing reliability against performance requirements.
